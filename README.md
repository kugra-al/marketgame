Very unfinished Laravel 8* trading game loosely based on the economy of the Mount & Blade games.

Focused around towns/cities that produce goods

Some larger NPC cities provide constant supply/demand

each building can produce something
each building can also be used to craft something
amount produced/crafted per tick relies on the number of workers doing it

This is not coded well. It's very sloppy and I learn a lot (of what not to do) making this. But it was a fun project I spent a few months on.
